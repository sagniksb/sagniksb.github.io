### Sagnik Bhattacharya
Currently a Business and Economics student, but always a student of the financial markets and entrepreneurship. I'm also fascinated by how economic policy affects our daily lives and love exploring new business models. You can find my latest thoughts and analysis on my Medium blog. Contact me on LinkedIn or by email!
